# Your Business Process Library
Build and maintain your business' digital process library in a practical, low-cost way without huge enterprise software systems.

**Requirement**: You have to meet ISO 9001 or some other standard for processes.

**Problem**: 
* Word files in the quality department are not helping the company perform to process.
* Or perhaps you have Word files in a SharePoint repository, yet how easy is it to track change requests and show auditable change histories for certification or recertification?

**Solution**: 
* Use Git-Process (free and open source approach) to develop, publish, and revise your business' key processes. 
* Use Github for change requests to track all changes over the lifecycle of each process (version history)
